// first we need to set up the server boilerplate
// imports (what do we need for this file?)
// middleware (same as most projects)
  // app.use(express.json())
// html routes (how to serve the two html files?)
// server listening (port and callback function)

// we need to set up the crud operations
  // writeToFile, readFromFile, deleteFromFile
// using fs


// then we need to set up the routes (from instructions)
// implement the crud operations based on the request
